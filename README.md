# Set Data Structure

## Description

This is a javascript implementation of a
[set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28abstract_data_type%29)
data structure.

A set data structure is an implementation of the mathematical concept of
a finite set.  A set is a collection of unique values (no duplicates) that
have no particular order.  A set is more concerned whether or not values
are contained in the set than the order in which they are added.

This implementation of a set inlcudes the common set operations of union,
intersection, difference, and subset.
